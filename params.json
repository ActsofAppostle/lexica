Players are given 3 to 30 minutes to find as many words as possible on a grid of random letters.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n * 4x4 and 5x5 game boards\r\n * A dictionary of 77,000+ words\r\n * UK and US dictionaries\r\n\r\n### Reporting Issues\r\n\r\nPlease report any issues or suggest features on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/lexica/lexica/issues).\r\n\r\n### Based on Lexic\r\n\r\nThis is a fork of the unmaintained but still fun [Lexic](http://code.google.com/p/lexic) game. Many thanks go out to the original developer(s) for their work on the game. We hope to build on this work to continue providing a good quality, fun, open source Android game.\r\n\r\nSome differences from the original are:\r\n * Removed unsupported multiplayer options\r\n * Better support for screens with higher resolutions\r\n * Action bar support\r\n * Minor Tweaks to the UI",
